        <p><strong>full name:</strong> bruce seiji wayne (his surname was formerly written as ueno. westernized semi-poorly in 1952 as wayne.)<br>
            <strong>aliases:</strong> the bat.<br>
            <strong>gender:</strong> cis male.<br>
            <strong>pronouns:</strong> he/him.<br>
            <strong>age:</strong> generally written at age 24+, mostly because that’s about when he returns to gotham. can be written earlier, but it’s a little more plotting. i very much welcome writing him when he’s older. he’s more well-adjusted then.<br>
            <strong>sexuality:</strong> something i can only call woefully bisexual.</p>
            <p><strong>ethnicity:</strong> japanese. nisei / second generation.<br>
            <strong>nationality:</strong> american.<br>
            <strong>spoken language(s):</strong> english and japanese, when he was younger. spent a lot of time learning other languages—spanish (for its commonality), italian, russian.<br>
            <strong>accent:</strong> average american accent.<br>
            <strong>religion:</strong> generally atheist. just not the type to believe in much of anything, although there was some mild shinto belief passed down.</p>
            <p><strong>occupation:</strong> splitting his life between vigilante and either ceo or upcoming heir. the playboy thing only happens once he’s in his 30s, really.<br>
            <strong>financial status:</strong> if he’s below 35, a millionaire (in the single digits). if he’s 35 or older, a billionaire (unfortunate).<br>
            <strong>education:</strong> graduated military school. didn’t so much get a college degree as much as globetrot taking classes that interested him or that were relevant to his interests. so, in truth, he went to college for around seven or so years.<br>
            <strong>physical diagnoses:</strong> chronic pain beyond belief - worse the longer he’s been running around as a vigilante. also, type 1 diabetes.<br>
            <strong>mental diagnoses:</strong> c-ptsd and possibly autism, depending on how you read the overlap between those symptoms, ocd, depression.</p>
            <br><br><br><p><strong>star sign:</strong> aquarius<br>
            <strong>alignment:</strong> neutral good. you might think he’d be lawful good, but that would sort of negate the vigilante thing.<br>
            <strong>mbti:</strong> intj (the architect)<br>
            <strong>five positives:</strong> confident, serious, loyal, innovative, driven.<br>
            <strong>five negatives:</strong> pessimistic, suspicious, solitary, ruthlessly practical, repressed.<br>
            <strong>skills:</strong> detective work, combat, engineering, an enormous amount of education in psychology, philosophy, and whatever else caught his interest. a quick thinker overall and always has some nightmarish contingency plan.<br>
            <strong>interests:</strong> russian literature. existentialism, unsurprisingly. philosophy. psychology. the idea of rehabilitation as something that you can&#39;t give up on. also, if you let this man sort legos for a while he will be quite happy.<br>
            <strong>intelligence:</strong> a genius by any reasonable account, even if he&#39;s mainly self-educated. he can hide it by putting on the playboy persona, but it&#39;s just that—a well-crafted persona built to hide the person underneath.</p>
            <p><strong>height:</strong> 5’11”.<br>
            <strong>weight:</strong> 170 lbs.<br>
            <strong>eye color:</strong> brown.<br>
            <strong>hair color:</strong> black.<br>
            <strong>body type:</strong> athletic / slender build. noticeably in shape and toned in her torso and arms.<br>
            <strong>piercings/tattoos:</strong> none.<br>
            <strong>scars:</strong> so, so many. more and more as he gets older. knives, bullets, broken bones that cut through the skin, and so many others.<br>
            <strong>speech:</strong> he’s a good speaker. direct. he’s learned how to speak well in order to present himself well. in other words, he’s masking. on his own he’s quieter, pensive, more spaces between his words. really depends on how social he’s pretending to be.<br>
            <strong>wardrobe:</strong> expensive but minimalist. mostly neutral colors, unremarkable but wealthy in cut and style. he does, in fact, avoid the collar gap. he has more casual clothing he keeps in his closet, but that’s mostly from the globetrotting days. </p>

        tetsuji and marumi ueno die in an alley in gotham city. two bullet wounds for each of them, the ueno family mostly dead. i mean, sure, it’s wayne in the business and on the buildings, but back home, it’s ueno. maybe there’s no difference.</p>he’s a trauma surgeon. he’s running for mayor. she’s an artist. they both love their son very much. that doesn't save their lives, but it's still worth something.</p>so they call it the wayne memorial hospital, and they don't put <i>tetsuji</i> on the building. for obvious reasons, you know?</p>so bruce wayne grows up in a mausoleum, alone, with a butler, a failing pancreas his father couldn't fix, a slowly crumbling skyscraper, and a million dollars shuttled into his bank account every year once he turns eighteen until he turns thirty-five. at three and a half decades old, he gets to take over wayne enterprises.</p>but first he has to get there. and the problem is getting there.</p>first it's the fights. bruce hits first at nine. he can't bear cruelty. back then his heart is open and raw, and all things prick until he bleeds. he loses the first fight and gets a reprimand and a black eye. loses the second. loses the third. it's then that the butler teaches him a little bit of how to fight, but also insists on counseling.</p>at twelve, the old man can't do it any more. compulsive behavior, violence, asocial tendencies, obsessive-compulsive disorder. he shuttles the last wayne scion off to the army and navy academy in carlsbad. their relationship begins to fracture under the weight. bruce stops going home for the holidays.</p>military academy for six years. at eighteen bruce breaks out into the world. there's an idea he's been forming all these years. about ideas of justice. about a bat.</p>you can backpack a lot of places if you're a sharp-eyed young man who knows how to hide his more off-putting tendencies. you can get into a lot of places—colleges, criminal organizations, fighting schools. he saves up for flights or ships. the millions keep piling up while he's overseas, and everyone's asking: where's the missing wayne heir, anyway?</p>he stays missing until he's twenty-four. then it's all in the tabloids. the prince of gotham's shown up again. he stays in his house. he repairs. he spends money frivolously on expensive clothes. he does a few stupid daring things—buys a sports car and races it just to get on the front pages, walks out of a local queer club and grins at the cameras, daring them all to keep writing about the wrong things. sketches out ideas for a suit. ideas for a car. ideas. ideas. ideas.</p>then he gets to the real work at twenty-five. the bat makes his debut. like a virus and antibodies, the city produces its own form of criminal in response. bruce fighting for purchase in a city trying to shake him off. and he holds on tighter. breaks his hands. breaks almost every bone in his body at least once, and he keeps holding on.</p>

wages war in a city flooded after the riddler blows the sea wall to bits. keeps holding on.</p>

makes a fake self, all easy grins and charm, to feed to the vultures and the paparazzi. keeps holding on.</p>

donates to diabetic funds. stops wearing pumps out on patrol because the activity rips out the infusion set. keeps holding on.</p>

why do it? do it for the city. do it for the picture-puzzle. do it for the wind, and the memory, and all the people you can't ever bring back from the dead. do it because no one else will. do it because if one kid's parents live to see the next dawn, it's all worth it.</p>

do it because if you dive off the babylon towers at exactly the right time, with a good cable and perfect aim, you can loop your throw around a gargoyle and land on the j-street el.</p>

and when the wind hits you on the way down, and it’s just you and your grip on the line, there's nothing like it.
