        i’m k, my pronouns are she/they, i’m 25, my time zone’s pst, and
        there’s a lot to say here, so let’s get into it.
      </div>
    <p>
      <span>CONTENT WARNING</span> this blog will have a lot of triggering
      content, including but not limited to: mental illness (c-ptsd, ocd, depresion, anxiety), violence,
      trauma, and current events. i tag for all of this as
      trigger tw, which translates as mental illness tw, drugs tw, etc.
      because of this, i <b>will not write with minors</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>ACTIVITY</span> this is a low activity blog. i will be on and
      off here as my brain works, and if i’m not here, you might find me at
      <b>@unerror</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>SHIPPING</span> i can ship, but i’m very careful about who i do
      and don’t ship with. bruce is naturally closed off as a person just as
      a self-protective measure, so patience is appreciated. i'm open to it!
      we just have to work with it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>WRITING & STYLE</span> i don't use icons and i use normal sized
      text. i don't mind if other people use small text. double small text
      can be hard for me to read sometimes. i generally write in third person.
      i might get funky with it and do first person here and there as a treat.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>ON CANON</span> please note that i've recast bruce as a japanese
      american man. this means that canon changes, and the relationship with
      gotham also changes. i also divert from canon and follow ideas from
      <i>batman: the imposter</i>, wherein bruce was sent to military school
      at a young age and then disappeared to begin globetrotting once he 
      turned eighteen. this creates an embittered, misanthropic guy.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>INTERACTIONS</span> down for whatever! ask memes, starter calls, all
      of it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>NEED A SUMMARY?</span> talk to me! see the about section here for a
      general overview of the differences.
